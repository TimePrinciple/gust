The delta data starts with the size of the base object and the size of the object to be reconstructed. 
These sizes are encoded using the size encoding from above. 
This is what b insert
The remainder of the delta data is a sequence of instructions to reconstruct the object from the base object. 
If the base object is deltified, it must be converted to canonical form first. 
Each instruction appends more and more data to the target object until itâ€™s complete. 
There are two supported instructions so far: 
one for copy a byte range from the source object and one for inserting new data embedded in the instruction itself.
